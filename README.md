## Task

Create a C++ program that will prompt the user for information about a student and their grades. The program should ask the user for the following information:

  -  User ID number (int)
  -  First name (string)
  -  Last name (string)
  -  Number of assignments (int)
  -  Grade for each of the assignments (series of doubles)
  
The program should then calculate the average score of the assignments and print the results (rounding the average to 1 digit after the decimal place).
